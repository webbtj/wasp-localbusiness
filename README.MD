# WASP LocalBusiness

### WASP?

**W**ordPress + **A**CF + **S**marty + **P**osts-to-Posts

### LocalBusiness?

LocalBusiness is a schema.org standard supported by Google and therefore the world.
This provides a bunch of info about your business to Google, Maps, etc.  
More Info: https://developers.google.com/structured-data/local-businesses/  
Schema.org specifications: http://schema.org/LocalBusiness  
Testing Tool: https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/  

### Requirements?
ACF, Smarty, Posts-to-Posts. You also need the ACF repeater field and options panel.
You also **need** to actually be using Smarty in your theme (Smarty will set it's compile
directory to what your theme's compile directory *should* be).

### WP Plugin Directory?

I dunno, probably not. Kind of sick of being forced into SVN to publish stuff.
Plus, this depends on ACF, Smarty, and Posts-to-Posts. It also uses some premium
ACF features like repeaters.

### Licence?

Whatever, GPL or something. Use it, it's free.
